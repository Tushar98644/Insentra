GITHUB_SECRET=""
GOOGLE_ID=""

```

Now, create your own credentials for the providers , OpenAI api and MongoDB cluster and place them in the corresponding fields ,put the email in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL` field which you want to give admin privileges

From the project folder, run these commands in the console (terminal) to install dependencies and run the app:

```bash
npm run dev -p 5000
# or
yarn dev -p 5000
# or
pnpm dev -p 5000
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will start all the containers listed in the docker-compose.yml file. There are two Dockerfile in the project. The command will build the Dockerfile.dev and start the server. The Dockerfile.dev file is used for development purposes. The Dockerfile file is used for production purposes.

To build the Dockerfile instead, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker build . -f Dockerfile -t <image-name>
```

The above command will build the Dockerfile file and create an image. To run the image, run the following command in the terminal:
